                            <p>While I was working with ‘Skills Hive’ as a freelance web developer, I built a fully responsive website from the designs given to me, by the client. I built the templates for the site in HTML, CSS, PHP and bootstrap. The template was uploaded to the CMS system Wordpress, so the client can maintain the website themselves.</p>
